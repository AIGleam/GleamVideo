DEFAULT_LANGUAGE = "en-us"
DEFAULT_SPEED = 1.2
```
Change `DEFAULT_VOICE` to other supported voices.

🔹 **No Video Output?** Ensure FFmpeg is installed.  
🔹 **Voice Sounds Robotic?** Adjust `DEFAULT_SPEED` in TTS settings.  
🔹 **Screenshots Not Working?** Make sure ChromeDriver matches your browser version.  
🔹 **Background Music Not Adding?** This feature is currently broken.
